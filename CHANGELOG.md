## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-03
- `$` — silent single-element query. `#id` fast path via `getElementById` (simple IDs only; compound selectors fall through to `querySelector`).
- `$.required` — throws if the element is missing. Replaces the `!` non-null assertion.
- `$.optional` — warns once per selector in dev when missing. Deduplicated.
- `$.exists` — boolean presence check.
- `$$` — `querySelectorAll` as an `Array`.
- `defineSelectors` — frozen, typed selector registry.
- Browser-only: throws a clear error under SSR (no `document`). Guard with `typeof window !== 'undefined'` in isomorphic code.
- ESM + CJS dual build. Internal modules (`query`, `isDev`, `warned`) are not exported.
